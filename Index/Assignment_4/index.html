                <p>Bowled : The batter can be bowled out if he or she fails to prevent the ball hitting his stumps. <br>
                    Caught : If the batter hits the ball and it is caught by one 
                    of the fielding side before it bounces, then he or she is out. <br>
                    Stumped : A batter can also be 'stumped by the wicketkeeper <br>
                    LBW : A batter can also be out 'leg before wicket' or 'lbw' if 
                    the umpire rules that the ball has hit the batterâ€™s protective leg pad when
                    it would have hit the stumps had their leg not been in the way. <br>
                    Run out : Either batter can be 'run-out' if the stumps towards which 
                    they are running are hit by the ball before they are inside their crease. <br>
